This repo contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a type error. The function `add` is defined to take two numbers as arguments and return their sum. However, in the call to the function, a string is passed as the second argument. This causes a type error because the function expects a number but receives a string.

The solution shows how to fix the error by using type guards or type assertions.
